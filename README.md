## Software Development I (CRN: 31774)
This is a CLI task manager that I created for my Java Programming course for my final project.

Upon running the program, you are presented with a series of options to manage your task lists. From there, you can select a specific task list to work with. 
Each task list can hold multiple tasks. Within a selected task list, you can create, read, update, and delete tasks. 
* Note that task data is stored in memory during the program's execution and is not saved upon closing.

The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate key programming concepts learned throughout the semester, with a strong emphasis on:

* **Inheritance:** Using inheritance to create different types of tasks with shared functionalities.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Implementing try-catch blocks to ensure the application gracefully handles invalid user input.
* **Abstraction:** Using abstraction to have seperation between the user interface and the underlying task management logic.
